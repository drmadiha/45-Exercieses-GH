//...........Q35............
//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. 
//• Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. 
//• Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 
//You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
let animal = ["Dog", "Cat", "COW"];
for (let i = 0; i < animal.length; i++) {
    console.log(`A ${animal[i]} would make a great pet.`);
}
console.log("Any of these animal  would make a wonderfull companion.");
